1Ô∏è‚É£ What will be the output of this code?

x = 5
y = "5"
print(x + int(y))
 output=10

2Ô∏è‚É£ How do you check the data type of a variable in Python?
just like print(type(x))

3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between = and ==?
= is used to assign a value and == is used to comapre values

4Ô∏è‚É£ How do you take user input in Python and convert it into an integer?
name=int(input("enter number="))


5Ô∏è‚É£ What are mutable and immutable data types in Python? Give examples.

Mutable (Can be changed after creation): list, set, dict

Immutable (Cannot be changed after creation): int, float, complex, bool, string, tuple, bytes

Now, let's step up! Answer these:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What will be the output of this code?

python
Copy
Edit
a = "5"
b = 2
print(a * b)
output:error# wrong Answer
Explanation: The * operator repeats the string. Since "5" * 2 means "5" + "5", the output is "55".

2Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between .append() and .extend() in lists?
append join the value 
extend add values

.append(x): Adds a single element as-is to the list.

.extend(iterable): Adds elements from an iterable (list, tuple, set) to the list.

lst = [1, 2, 3]
lst.append([4, 5])  # Appends the whole list as a single element
print(lst)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]

lst = [1, 2, 3]
lst.extend([4, 5])  # Adds each element individually
print(lst)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]



3Ô∏è‚É£ What does range(5, 10, 2) return?
it mean from 5 to 10 with  increment of 2

4Ô∏è‚É£ How do you check if a key exists in a dictionary?
 if key in dic:
 print "key exists"

  Correct Answer:

is checks if two variables point to the same memory location (identity comparison).

== checks if two variables have the same value (value comparison).

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

print(a == b)  # True (Same values)
print(a is b)  # False (Different objects in memory)



5Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between is and == in Python?

is mean exoct a particulary value in particular thing
== mean comparison
